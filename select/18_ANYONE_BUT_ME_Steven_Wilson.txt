A ton of love comes down the line
A place I'll never go
No one will ever know
I kiss the hand I cannot hold
I scale the mountain top
Just for the photo op

And when I see what I have done
Laid out on the page
It takes my breath away
I don't mind that it's not real
What difference does it make?
You believe it anyway

I wanna be anyone but me now
I wanna be anywhere but here now
Wanna believe anything I choose now
I wanna have anything I want now
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I stole this song from someone else (from someone else)
But how is that a crime
If it still sounds like mine?
The time I could have spent with you (spent time with you)
Is there for all to see
And that's good enough for me
Oh, yeah

I wanna be anyone but me now
I wanna be anywhere but here now
Wanna believe anything I choose now
I wanna have anything I want now

Take the stairway to where you wanna be, yeah
A show you never saw
A dress you never wore
Reflecting back at me the kudos and the praise
From friends I've never met
Hope they don't forget

I wanna be anyone but me now
I wanna be anywhere but here now
Wanna believe anything I choose now
I wanna have anything I want now
