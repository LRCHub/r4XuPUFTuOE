No more strenght, no more hope
Down down it goes
No more vision I just try and cope
Down down it goes
You see me hanging on my feet
Upside down in this hole
Will you throw me a lifeline
Or just stand by and watch me turn old

Oh I can't I can't I can't fight this on my own
Oh I can't I can't I can't deal with this alone
Oh I can't I can't I can't believe we are stranded in this situation
We thought anybody could end up in but surely never us

There are plans then there comes life
On on it goes
I try to take it I changed my goals
Oh and who knows:
It might be different for the better
Something I never would have hoped for
I'll find some answers along the way
At least I try to watch and learn and grow

But I can't I can't I can't fight this on my own
No I can't I can't I can't deal with this alone
Oh I can't I can't I can't believe we are stranded in this situation
We thought anybody could end up in but surely never us
No surely never us
Anyone but us

Anyone oh anyone but us
Anyone oh anyone but us
Anyone oh anyone but us
Anyone but us

No more strenght, no more hope
Down down it goes
No more vision I just try and cope
Down down it goes
