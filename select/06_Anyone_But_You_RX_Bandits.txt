I know i was wrong
So please just take this offering, its all of me
Black spins circles around my conscience
This stale responsibility is killing me
- Chorus -
Hey, i never wanted to hurt anyone but you did
What did you say
Its days like these i think i'll never go back out there
Its easier to be alone like this
- -
Impossible, inflatable too
So why don't you contribute to
The effortless falling then i'm down about
It's killing me
- Chorus -
And if you stay, then i'm still lost
In some ways this world has more to say to you
Come out of the rain
And if it won't stop then i'm going home
Consider me forgot
- Chorus -
